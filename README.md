# audioguies-moniques

Experimental audioguide system developed in the frame of an artistic residence at Centre d'Arts Santa MÃ²nica, Barcelona. This code uses the reading of RFID codes to play audio files using an Arduino and a DFPlayer Pro. The code allows audio tracks either to start from the beginning or to start in the middle of the track, while keeping time.
